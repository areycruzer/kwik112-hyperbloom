/**
 * @module incident
 * @description Shared, call-derived display helpers used across the console
 *              (queue, kanban, history, map, and the detail page).
 *
 *              A NORMAL project module: it uses ordinary imports and carries no
 *              `node --test` suite. It exists because these helpers were
 *              previously copy-pasted into four or five views, and the copies
 *              had already drifted — the map read a low incident as `P4` while
 *              every other view read `P3`, and an early `distressOf` returned a
 *              number for a never-measured call. One definition each, here, is
 *              what stops that recurring.
